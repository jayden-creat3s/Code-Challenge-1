Simplified Mobile Money Transaction Fee Estimator ðŸ“±

Welcome to the Simplified Mobile Money Transaction Fee Estimator!  
This tool helps you easily estimate transaction fees when sending money using a straightforward, transparent fee structure.

 Why Use This Estimator?

Transaction fees can be confusing. This estimator simplifies the calculation by:

- Applying a **flat 1.5%** fee on your transaction amount.
- Ensuring a **minimum fee of KES 10** so small transactions donâ€™t get charged too little.
- Capping the fee at a **maximum of KES 70** to protect you from large fees on high-value transfers.


How It Works

1. When prompted, enter the amount of money you wish to send (KES).

2. The program calculates:
   - 1.5% of the entered amount.
   - If this calculated fee is less than KES 10, it charges KES 10.
   - If itâ€™s more than KES 70, it charges KES 70.
   
3. You then see the breakdown of your transaction fee and the total amount debited from your account.

Usage
1. Open the `mobileMoneyEstimator/fee.js` file.
2. Run the script in a JavaScript environment (e.g., browser console).
3. Follow the prompt to enter the amount of money they wish to send
